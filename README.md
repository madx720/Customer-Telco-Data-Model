# Customer-Telco-Data-Model


This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques.



Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv". It contains information about:

Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents)

Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)

Services used (phone, internet, online security, tech support, etc.)

Charges (monthly and total)

Churn status

Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1) Data Loading and Understanding

2) Data Preprocessing

3) Exploratory Data Analysis

4) Feature Engineering

5) Model Building and Evaluation

6) Hyperparameter Tuning

7) Model Selection

8) Addressing Class Imbalance

9) Final Model Evaluation



Following dependencies are needed to be installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn
xgboost

Key Findings

The dataset contains 7,043 customer records with 21 features.
There is a class imbalance in the target variable (Churn).
Random Forest Classifier performed the best among the models tested.
Hyperparameter tuning and addressing class imbalance improved model performance.
